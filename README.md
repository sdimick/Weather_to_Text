# Weather to Text

## What This Is
This is a little python script that goes and gets the 18 hour weather forecast online
and texts it to me daily. It sends three separate texts messages, each including six
hours, listing the hour, forecasted temp, and chance of precipitation.

## What's In the Repo?
I've included a copy of the script, obviously sans personal details, as well as
a screenshot of the results.

## Why Did I Make This?
    * I took a python class on Coursera and wanted to make use of it
    * I check the weather every morning for temp and rain and this saves time
    * When I check the weather first thing in the morning I often forget it and have to
    reopen the weather app multiple times, this way it's stored on my phone as a text
